## Packlist

This is a way for me to play around with Chrome packaged apps. Basically, it's a to-do list app focused on packing lists. To try it out:

- pull down the repo
- `npm install`
- `bower install`
- `grunt`
- open Chrome
- go to `chrome://extensions`
- click "Developer mode"
- click "Load unpacked extension..."
- browse to the `app` subdirectory of this repo
- go to the new tab page and click on Packlist
