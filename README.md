## Packlist

This is a way for me to play around with Chrome packaged apps. Basically, it's a to-do list app focused on packing lists.

To try it out, pull down the repo, open Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`, click "Developer mode", click "Load unpacked extension...", and browse to the `app` subdirectory of this repo.
